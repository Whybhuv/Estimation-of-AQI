# Estimation-of-AQI
This project aims to estimate AQI from images using machine learning techniques. The model uses image processing techniques to extract features from the images that are related to air quality, such as the amount of haze or smog in the image. The model is trained on these features to predict the AQI and can provide real-time estimates of AQI.
